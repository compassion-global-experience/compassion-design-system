## Overview

The type component is a fundamental element in any design system. It is used to display text-based content such as headings, paragraphs, and labels.

## Usage

One approach to achieving a cohesive look and feel in a design system is by using consistent typography. This means that the same font family, font sizes, font weights, and other typographical elements are used throughout the system. By doing so, it creates a sense of unity and cohesiveness in the design, which can ultimately make it more impactful and memorable.

### Elements

- Eyebrow: Use an eyebrow to provide additional context or emphasis to a heading. This is typically a smaller font size than the heading itself.
- Heading: Use a heading to introduce new sections of content. Headings should be clear and descriptive, and should accurately reflect the content that follows. Use appropriate font size and weight to ensure that headings stand out from other text elements on the page.
- Line: A visual accent that helps separate the heading from a subheading or body type.
- Subheading: Use a subheading to provide additional information or context to a heading. This is typically a smaller font size than the heading itself, but larger than body text. Use appropriate font size and weight to ensure that subheadings stand out from body text while still being visually distinct from headings.
- Body: Use the body type for paragraphs and other blocks of text. This is typically a smaller font size than the subheading, but larger than captions or labels. Use appropriate font size and line spacing to ensure readability, and consider breaking up longer blocks of text with headings or subheadings to improve organization and scanability.

### Color, Size & Weight

To ensure consistency across your design, it's recommended to use our design tokens to manage typography attributes such as font size, weight, and color. When selecting these values, consider the hierarchy of your content and the context in which it will be displayed.

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate font sizes and weights to ensure readability.
- Use consistent typography across your design system for a cohesive look and feel.
- Avoid using too many different fonts and styles, as this can make your design look cluttered.
- Use appropriate line spacing to improve readability.
- Use color contrast to ensure text is legible, especially for users with visual impairments.
- Test your text component across different devices and platforms to ensure it displays correctly.
