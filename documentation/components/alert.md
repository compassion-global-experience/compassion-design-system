## Overview

The alert component is a visual cue that is used to bring attention to important messages or notifications. In the design system, the alert component is designed with a clear and concise layout, using colors and typography that are easy to read and understand.

## Usage

The alert component should be used sparingly and only for important messages that require immediate attention. It should be used in situations such as error messages, success messages, warnings or notifications. The content of the alert should be brief and to the point, communicating the message effectively.

### Status

- Primary: The primary status for the alert component is used as the default state and does not indicate any specific type of message. It is used for general notifications and messages.
- Danger: Indicates a critical or dangerous situation that requires immediate attention. For example, a "danger alert" might be used to indicate an error or an issue that could cause harm or damage.
- Warning: Indicates a situation that requires attention, but is not critical. For example, a "warning alert" might be used to indicate that an action will have consequences or that a feature is being phased out.
- Success: Indicates a successful action or completion of a task. For example, a "success alert" might be used to indicate that an order has been successfully processed or that a user has successfully updated their account.
- Neutral: Indicates a general message or information. For example, a "neutral alert" might be used to provide information about system maintenance or to provide an update on a feature release.

### Icon

Icons can be shown or hidden to the left of the alert message to provide additional context and help users quickly understand the type of message. The icon should be chosen based on the status of the alert. For example, a danger alert might use an icon of a warning sign or exclamation point.

### Slot

The slot component is used to provide additional content or functionality within the alert component. It can be used to display additional information or actions related to the alert message.

## Best Practices
