## Overview

A modal is a type of user interface component that appears on top of the main content and gives the user opportunity interact with it before returning to the main content.

## Usage

Modals are commonly used in web and mobile design to display important information, gather user input, or confirm an action before it is taken. Modals can also be used to provide context or additional details about a specific element without taking the user away from the main interface.

### Size

**Default:** The default size for a modal.

**Small:** A smaller size for a modal that is useful for displaying shorter messages or requiring less user input.

**Wide:** A wider size for a modal that is useful for displaying more information or longer forms.

### Header

The header can be hidden or shown depending on the design of the modal. It typically contains a title but can also include additional information or functionality.

### Footer

The footer can be hidden or shown depending on the design of the modal. It typically contains buttons for actions related to the modal, such as "Cancel" or "Save", but can also include additional information or functionality.

### Slot

A modal has slots in the body and footer, allowing content to be added to those sections. For example, the body slot could be used to display a form or additional information, while the footer slot could be used to add custom buttons or links.

## Best Practices

- Use modals sparingly and only when necessary, as they can interrupt the user flow and make the experience feel disjointed.
- Make sure the modal is easy to dismiss, either by including a clear "Close" button or allowing the user to click outside of the modal to close it.
- Use clear and concise language in the modal content to avoid confusion or misunderstandings.
