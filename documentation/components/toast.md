## Overview

The toast component is a small, non-intrusive message that appears on the screen to give feedback or provide information to the user. It usually disappears automatically after a few seconds or can be dismissed manually. 

## Usage

The toast component is often used to display success or error messages, notifications, or alerts. It should be placed in a non-intrusive area of the screen, such as the bottom or top right corner.

**Slot**

The slot is used to include custom content within the toast component. This allows for greater flexibility and customization of the message being displayed.

**Actions**

By default, the toast includes a close button to dismiss the message. However, this button can be replaced with a single or double call to action, depending on the context of the message.

**Image**

The toast can also include an image, which can be toggled on the left side of the message.

**Icon**

The toast can also include an icon, which can be toggled on the left side of the message. The icon should be chosen based on the context of the message and should help to reinforce the message being communicated. For example, a checkmark icon could be used for a success message, while a warning icon could be used for an error message.

## Best Practices

- Keep the message short and concise to ensure it is easily readable and understood.
- Use clear and descriptive language to ensure the message is not misinterpreted.
- Ensure the message is relevant and adds value to the user experience.
- Use appropriate colors and icons to reinforce the message and create a visually appealing design.
