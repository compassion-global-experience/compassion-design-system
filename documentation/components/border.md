## Overview

A border is a decorative element that can be used to visually separate and distinguish one section of content from another. 

## Usage

Borders can be applied to any element to add a subtle visual element and improve the overall design of the interface. They are commonly used to separate different sections of content, such as a header from the main content or a menu from the rest of the interface. Borders can also be used to indicate relationships between different elements, such as grouping related buttons or highlighting a selected item in a list.

### Color

Default: This refers to the default color of the border, which is typically a subtle shade that complements the overall color scheme of the design.

Primary: This refers to a more prominent color that is used to draw attention to specific elements or sections of content. It is often used to highlight important information or to indicate a call-to-action.

### Border Radius

By default, borders have a sharp edge. However, the border radius can be changed to create a rounded effect. This can be especially useful for creating a softer visual style or for emphasizing certain elements.

## Best Practices

- Use borders sparingly: While borders can be a great way to add visual interest to your design, using too many borders can make the interface feel cluttered and overwhelming.
- Keep it consistent: If you're using borders to separate different sections of content, be sure to use the same border style and thickness throughout the interface. This will help create a consistent visual hierarchy and improve the overall user experience.
- Use color intentionally: When choosing a border color, be sure to consider the overall color scheme of your design. If you're using a dark background color, a light-colored border may be more visible and effective. Conversely, if you're using a light background color, a darker border may be more appropriate.
