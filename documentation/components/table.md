## Overview

A table is a collection of rows and columns used to organize and display data. They can be used to compare and analyze data, as well as to present information in a clear and organized manner.

## Usage

Tables can be used to create schedules, pricing charts, and other types of data-driven content. When using tables, it's important to consider the amount of information being presented and to ensure that the table is easy to read and understand.

### **table-column**

A group of table cells arranged in a column. Multiple columns can be added side by side to create a full table.

**Heading**

The table heading can be shown or hidden for each column

### **table-head**

The table head is the top section of a table that contains the column headings. It helps to identify the content of each column and makes it easier to read and understand the data presented in the table. The table head is usually highlighted or styled differently than the rest of the table to visually separate it from the table body.

**State**

- Default: The default state of a table head.
- Hover: The state of a table head when the user's cursor is hovering over it.
- Active: The state of a table head when it is being interacted with, such as when it is clicked on.
- Disabled: The state of a table head when it cannot be interacted with or selected.

### **table-cell**

A table cell is a single unit of data in a table, located at the intersection of a row and a column. It can contain text, numbers, or other types of data.

**State**

- Default: The default state of a table cell.
- Hover: The state of a table cell when the user's cursor is hovering over it.
- Active: The state of a table cell when it is being interacted with, such as when it is clicked on.
- Disabled: The state of a table cell when it cannot be interacted with or selected.

**Slot**

The slot can be used to include custom content in a table cell.

## Best Practices

- Keep the table simple and easy to read
- Use contrasting colors to make the data stand out
- Avoid using too many columns or rows, as this can make the table difficult to read
- Use clear and concise headings for each column to help users understand the content of the table
