## Overview

A tooltip is a small, contextual hint that appears when a user hovers over or clicks on an element. Its purpose is to provide additional information or clarification about that element.

## Usage

Tooltips can be used in a variety of design contexts, such as in buttons, icons, form fields, and navigation menus. They are particularly useful when there is limited space to provide additional information, or when users may need clarification on a specific element. 

### Placement

Tooltips can be placed in four directions: top, bottom, left, and right, depending on the context and the layout of the element.

## Best Practices

- Keep tooltips concise and focused on providing useful information.
- Make sure tooltips are visually distinct from other elements on the page, such as by using a different background color or font size.
- When deciding where to place a tooltip, consider the user's expected behavior and the context in which the tooltip will appear.
- It should be placed close to the element it refers to, but not obstruct the user's view or interaction.
