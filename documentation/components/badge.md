## Overview

A badge is a small visual element used to represent a status, a message, or a notification. It is commonly used to draw attention to important information or actions.

## Usage

Ensure that the badge is visually distinct from other elements on the page and use color to convey meaning, while also ensuring that the colors used meet accessibility guidelines. Keep the text on the badge short and concise, and use badges sparingly and only for important information or actions.

### Status

- **Primary**: Used to highlight the main action or feature of a product or page.
- **Warning**: Used to indicate a potential issue or problem that the user should be aware of.
- **Danger**: Used to indicate a critical issue or problem that requires the user's immediate attention.
- **Success**: Used to indicate a successful action or completion of a task.
- **Info**: Used to provide additional information or context that may be helpful to the user.
- **Neutral**: Used to provide a non-emphasized, neutral piece of information or action.

### Border-Radius

By default, badges have a rounded border. However, the border-radius can be changed to make the badge pill-shaped if desired.

### Other Properties

- **Icons**: Optional icons can be added to the right or left of the badge text to provide additional context to the user.
- **Text Visibility**: The badge text can be shown or hidden depending on the design requirements.

- Use badges sparingly and only for important information or actions.
- Keep the text on the badge short and concise.
