## Overview

The button component is an interactive element that can be used to trigger an action or change the state of an interface element.

## Usage

Buttons can be used in a variety of contexts throughout a design. They are particularly useful for triggering actions such as submitting a form, opening a modal, or navigating to a different page. They can also be used to change the state of an interface element, such as toggling a setting on or off.

### Kind

- **Default:** A typical button style that can be used in most contexts and uses the primary brand color.
- **CTA:** Stands for "Call to Action". This button style is used to draw attention to the most important action on a page.
- **White:** A button style that is used on a dark background. The text is usually dark and the button itself is usually light.
- **Inverted:** A button style that is used on a light background. The text is usually light and the button itself is usually dark.
- **Destructive:** A button style that is used to indicate that an action will have a negative consequence, such as deleting data.

### Emphasis

- **Primary:** Should be used for primary actions or to draw the user's attention. The color and style of the primary button are designed to stand out on the page.
- **Secondary:**  For less prominent actions and should be used alongside primary buttons as a secondary option.
- **Tertiary:** The least prominent and should be used for less important actions, or when the design requires a more subtle button.

### Size

- **Medium:** For most contexts and is easy to interact with on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Small:** For situations where space is limited or when multiple buttons need to be displayed in close proximity.
- **Large:** Used to draw attention to a specific action or for use on touch screens where larger targets are needed.

### State

- **Default:** The normal appearance of a button when it is not being interacted with. It is usually a solid color with text that indicates the action the button will perform when clicked.
- **Hover:** When the user hovers their mouse over the button. It is usually a subtle change in appearance, such as a color change, to indicate to the user that the button is interactive.
- **Disabled:** The appearance of a button when it cannot be interacted with. This is typically used when the user has not filled out a required form field or when the user is not authorized to perform a certain action. The button is usually grayed out or has a different opacity to indicate that it is not active.

### Other Properties

- **Icons**: Optional icons can be added to the right or left of the button text to provide additional context to the user.
- Text **Visibility**: The button text can be shown or hidden depending on the design requirements.

## Best Practices

- Ensure your buttons have clear labels. Users should be able to predict what will happen when they click a button. Avoid using generic labels like "Click here".
- Only use CTA buttons to highlight the main call to action on a page.
- Limit the number of actions a user can take at one time. If there are too many buttons on one page, it can lead to decision fatigue for the user.
- Use button sizes that are large enough to accommodate finger targets for touch screens.
