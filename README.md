# Compassion Design System

The Compassion Design System is a broad suite of tools, knowledge, best
practices, and research with a singular goal: creating experiences that make our
neighbours feel known, loved, and connected every time they interact with one of
our digital experiences.

The CDS (Compassion Design System)’s Digital Design Kit contains everything you
need to begin designing and building neighbor-centric digital experiences with
Compassion's _Known, Loved, and Connected_ brand promise at heart.

This is a monorepo for the many projects that make up Compassion International’s design system:

- [Reusable React components](./packages/components/react-web) and [web
  components](./packages/components/web-components) libraries
- [Tokens and JavaScript helpers for design elements](./packages/elements)
- [Examples](./packages/examples) of practical usage of the CDS

## Installing Tools

The Digital Design toolkit is available both as a set of React components as
well as web components.

### React Components

To install the React components to your project, run either `npm i -D @compassion-gds/react-web` or `yarn i @compassion-gds/react-web`.

### Web Components

A set of web components is provided for non-React projects, such as those built
with “vanilla” HTML, Wordpress, .NET, Rails, or other server-side technologies.
