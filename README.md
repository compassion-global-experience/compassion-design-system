# Compassion Design System

The Compassion Design System is a broad suite of tools, knowledge, best
practices, and research with a singular goal: creating experiences that make our
neighbours feel known, loved, and connected every time they interact with one of
our digital experiences.

The CDS (Compassion Design System)’s Digital Design Kit contains everything you
need to begin designing and building neighbor-centric digital experiences with
Compassion's _Known, Loved, and Connected_ brand promise at heart.

This is a monorepo for the many projects that make up Compassion International’s design system:

- [vanilla/css classes](packages/core)
- [Reusable React components](packages/react)
- [Examples](examples) of practical usage of the CDS
