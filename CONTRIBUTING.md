# Contributing to Compassion’s Design System

1. This project uses **node.js** and **npm**. 
**npm** comes preinstalled with node. You can install nodejs following the steps here: https://nodejs.org/en/

2. We keep the development experience consistent by making sure everyone is using the same
(or compatible) nodejs/npm version with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
run `nvm use` in the project root and this would automatically switch you to the
correct version specified in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc)

3. The project is structured as a monorepo, run `npm run bootstrap` to install all dependencies

4. **Next Steps.** That’s it! See each package’s CONTRIBUTING document for more
   instructions that are package-specific:

    - [packages/css](./packages/css/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    - [packages/react](packages/react/CONTRIBUTING.md)

_(Todo: create the CONTRIBUTING pages)_
