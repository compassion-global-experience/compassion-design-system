# Logo

Compassion’s logo is the cornerstone of our visual identity. The presence of
Compassion’s mission statement reinforces the emotional appeal of our brand and
makes the logo motivating and recognizable.

At smaller sizes, legibility concerns may make it necessary to use a logo
variation that omits the mission statement. The “minimal” variant is provided
for this purpose.

Regardless of size, the Compassion logo should never be rendered in colors other
than those provided by the component.
