# Compassion Design System

The Compassion Design System is Compassion’s open-source toolkit to
accelerate designing, building, and delivering **neighbour-centered digital
experiences** that are robust, consistent, accessible and brand-aligned. The
CDS empowers teams to create cohesive experiences for all of our neighbours
across the globe.

The CDS provides interconnected patterns and shared practices that are eagerly
shared to Compassion’s growing global community of designers and developers.
Its working code, design resources, and UI guidelines will get your project off
the ground in no time—and the repeatable problems the design system solves will
free up time for designers and developers to solve more complex problems.

## How it’s assembled

    <h3>Elements</h3>
    <p>
      The CDS follows the tenets of <em>atomic design</em> by starting with the
      simplest pieces—referred to as <b>Elements</b>. Elements are parts of a
      design like color, depth, and typography that can’t be broken down any
      further.

<Card image={<img src="/images/components.jpg" alt="Electronics components" />}>
  <h3>Components</h3>
  <p>
    Elements are assembled with each other to build <b>Components</b> that begin
    to look familiar within an app or website. Components are uncomplicated
    pieces of a layout such as buttons, individual form elements, or progress
    bars.

    <h3>Layouts</h3>
    <p>
      Components and Elements are then combined into <b>Layouts</b> that start
      to reveal the meaning and function of a particular section of an
      interface. A Layout could consist of text and an image contained within a
      card, a file uploader, or a group of inputs assembled into a form.
