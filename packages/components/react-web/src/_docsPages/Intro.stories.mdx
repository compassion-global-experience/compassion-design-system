# Intro

The Compassion Design System is Compassion’s open-source design toolkit to
accelerate designing, building, and delivering **neighbour-centered digital
experiences** that are robust, consistent, accessible and brand-aligned. The
CDS empowers teams to create cohesive experiences for all of our neighbours
across the globe.

The CDS provides interconnected patterns and shared practices that are eagerly
shared to Compassion’s growing global community of designers and developers.
Its working code, design resources, and UI guidelines will get your project off
the ground in no time—and the repeatable problems the design system solves will
free up time for designers and developers to solve more complex problems.

## How it’s assembled

### Elements

The CDS follows the tenets of _atomic design_ by starting with the simplest
pieces—referred to as **Elements**. Elements are parts of a design like color,
depth, and typography that can’t be broken down any further.

### Components

Elements are assembled with each other to build **Components** that begin to
look familiar within an app or website. Components are uncomplicated pieces of
a layout such as buttons, individual form elements, or progress bars.

### Layouts

Components and Elements are then combined into **Layouts** that start to reveal
the meaning and function of a particular section of an interface. A Layout
could consist of text and an image contained within a card, a file uploader, or
a group of inputs assembled into a form.
