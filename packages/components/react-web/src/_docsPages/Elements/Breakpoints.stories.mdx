# Breakpoints

Breakpoints allow designs to respond to groups of viewport sizes and
orientations. Because accounting for every screen width is nigh impossible,
layouts should be **fluid** between breakpoints, sized in percentages or
viewport units.

An easy way to practice this methodology is “mobile first” design: Design for
narrow viewports first, adding larger breakpoints as needed. Be sure to use
`min-width` conditions in your media queries to more easily enable this
approach.

It’s recommended that designs work on viewports as narrow as 320px, but this
guideline isn’t solely meant to support mobile users! While
[7% of mobile browsing in 2020 happened on devices 320px in width](https://worship.agency/mobile-screen-sizes-for-2021),
WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines state that sites should function at a width of
320px without a horizontal scrollbar to ensure proper reflow when users have
zoomed their browser up to 400%. _See
[WCAG 2.1 Criteria 1.4.10](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html)._

## Breakpoint widths &amp; usage

To use breakpoint values provided by the Compassion Design System, import the
`breakpoints` object from the `@compassion-gds/elements` package:

```js
import { breakpoints } from '@compassion-gds/elements';
```

`breakpoints` is a JSON object with pixel widths that can be passed into your
media queries via CSS custom properties (variables), CSS-in-JS, or any other
method you choose.

export const Sm = styled.div`
  width: ${breakpoints.sm};
`;

export const Md = styled.div`
  width: ${breakpoints.md};
`;

export const Lg = styled.div`
  width: ${breakpoints.lg};
`;

export const Xl = styled.div`
  width: ${breakpoints.xl};
`;

export const Xxl = styled.div`
  width: ${breakpoints.xxl};
`;

export const Wrapper = styled.div`
  display: grid;
  grid-gap: 2rem;
  grid-auto-rows: repeat(5, auto);
  .breakpoint {
    padding: 0.5rem;
    background: #f0f0f0;
    box-shadow: ${depth.plus1};
  }
  code {
    border: 0;
    background: transparent;
  }
`;

<Wrapper>
  <Sm className="breakpoint">
    <code>breakpoints.sm (576px)</code>
  </Sm>
  <Md className="breakpoint">
    <code>breakpoints.md (768px)</code>
  </Md>
  <Lg className="breakpoint">
    <code>breakpoints.lg (992px)</code>
  </Lg>
  <Xl className="breakpoint">
    <code>breakpoints.xl (1200px)</code>
  </Xl>
  <Xxl className="breakpoint">
    <code>breakpoints.xxl (1400px)</code>
  </Xxl>
</Wrapper>
