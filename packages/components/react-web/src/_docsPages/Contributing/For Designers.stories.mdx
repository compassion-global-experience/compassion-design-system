# Contributing: For Designers

Let's build a better Compassion as we build a better Design System together! The
Design System is offered with an open heart and open hands; we welcome your
feedback, input, and explorations. Feel empowered to take the initiative—suggest
an enhancement or new component that has been valuable in your own work and for
the neighbours you serve. Anyone can initiate a change—you don't have to be a
designer or developer; an idea sketched on paper is more than enough to get the
conversation started!

Here's how it works:

1. If you need a component that’s not yet in the Digital Design Kit, or if a
   current component doesn’t quite meet your team’s need, reach out via email,
   Teams, or open a GitHub issue and give us all the details so we can follow
   up.

2. We'll set up a time to talk—or we can have an asynchronous conversation—and
   determine if an existing component or layout could be adapted to meet your
   need. There may also be one being built that you could help us test. If new
   work is required, we'll work alongside you to help determine the best
   solution that meets your neighbour needs in a broadly applicable way.

3. We'll work together to write requirements and acceptance criteria and add
   them to the appropriate team’s backlog. We'll prioritize the work publicly if
   it’s added to the CDS backlog.

4. Build the component in Figma. (Please set your [nudge size to
   8px](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404575206295-Set-small-and-big-nudge-values)!)
   Add in-place documentation within Figma.

5. We'll also need to ensure the component exists in our coded component
   libraries. If you know a developer who can partner with you, have them follow
   the steps in [Contributing: For Developers](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Contribute-For-Developers-83c7217888ef4722a4ced04555af6d50).
   If you don't know a developer, reach out to us and we'll partner with you to
   finish out your contribution!

6. The Design System team will review the addition to the Digital Design Kit
   with you and make a plan to iterate if needed.

7. We'll add the component to the Digital Design Kit and validate behavior,
   appearance, and function.

8. The team will determine an upcoming release to publish your addition.

9. We'll communicate about your contribution via email and Teams to highlight
   the new functionality!
