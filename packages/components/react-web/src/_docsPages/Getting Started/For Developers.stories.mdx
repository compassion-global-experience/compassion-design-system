# Getting Started: For Developers

## What Is the Compassion Design System?

The Compassion Design System is a broad suite of tools, knowledge, best
practices, and research with a singular goal: creating experiences that make our
neighbours feel known, loved, and connected every time they interact with one of
our digital experiences.

## What Is the Digital Design Kit?

The CDS (Compassion Design System)’s Digital Design Kit contains everything you
need to begin designing and building neighbor-centric digital experiences with
Compassion's brand promise at heart.

Over time the CDS will incorporate many more kits (for topics like Brand, Comms,
Social, and more) to help equip our neighbours in building all varieties of
experiences. For now, we’re starting with the most pressing and requested - the
Digital Design Kit.

### Guiding Principles of the Compassion Design System

_These Guiding Principles drive every aspect of the CDS: Why, how, and what we
build, along with the standards every neighbour who contributes to the system
should aspire._

- **Accessible:** It strives to serve every neighbour regardless of ability,
  language, culture, or locale.
- **Memorable:** It unlocks delightful experiences our neighbours will remember.
- **Bold:** It strives to push the limits of what’s possible with the modern web
  to engage neighbours in transformative and unexpected ways.
- **Connected:** It facilitates cohesive experiences for our neighbours that
  affirm they are known, loved, and connected in every interaction.
- **Empowering:** It encourages an empathetic approach and enables experiences
  that equip others to act, create, and engage.
- **Simple:** It seeks to capture attention with uncomplicated beauty and to serve
  our neighbours with unparalleled functionality.
