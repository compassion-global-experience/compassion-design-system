# Getting Started: For Designers

## What Is the Compassion Design System?

The Compassion Design System is a broad suite of tools, knowledge, best
practices, and research with a singular goal: creating experiences that make our
neighbours feel known, loved, and connected every time they interact with one of
our digital experiences.

## What Is the Digital Design Kit?

The CDS (Compassion Design System)’s Digital Design Kit contains everything you
need to begin designing and building neighbor-centric digital experiences with
Compassion's brand promise at heart.

Over time the CDS will incorporate many more kits (for topics like Brand, Comms,
Social, and more) to help equip our neighbours in building all varieties of
experiences. For now, we’re starting with the most pressing and requested - the
Digital Design Kit.

### Guiding Principles of the Compassion Design System

_These Guiding Principles drive every aspect of the CDS: Why, how, and what we
build, along with the standards every neighbour who contributes to the system
should aspire._

- **Accessible:** It strives to serve every neighbour regardless of ability,
  language, culture, or locale.
- **Memorable:** It unlocks delightful experiences our neighbours will remember.
- **Bold:** It strives to push the limits of what’s possible with the modern web
  to engage neighbours in transformative and unexpected ways.
- **Connected:** It facilitates cohesive experiences for our neighbours that
  affirm they are known, loved, and connected in every interaction.
- **Empowering:** It encourages an empathetic approach and enables experiences
  that equip others to act, create, and engage.
- **Simple:** It seeks to capture attention with uncomplicated beauty and to serve
  our neighbours with unparalleled functionality.

## Getting Started

You're just a few clicks away from tapping into a global community of designers
and developers who are leveraging their talent to serve those in poverty! Here's
how to join in:

### Installing Tools

1. Email [globalux@compassion.com](mailto:globalux@compassion.com?subject=Compassion%20Design%20System%20access!) to get access to Compassion's Figma
   organization
2. If needed, we'll create a team within Figma that suits your
   needs—the Design System will automatically be enabled as a Figma library for
   all projects you create

That's it! You can validate access to the Design System by creating a new Figma
design file and clicking "Assets" in the top-left next to the "Layers" menu
item. Click the "Team Library" icon and you should see the Compassion Design
System library toggled on.

_For additional instructions on how to use Figma Libraries, [check
here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041051154-Guide-to-libraries-in-Figma)!_

That's it! You can validate access to the Design System by:

1. Creating a new Figma file
2. Clicking "Assets" in the top left next to the
   "Layers" menu
3. Click the "Team Library" icon
4. The Compassion Design System
   library should be toggled on
5. Do a little dance

<!-- ### Installing Fonts

[If necessary. To come pending visual identity—fonts can be distributed
automatically within Figma assuming we've licensed them correctly] -->

### Explore!

- Check out the **in-place documentation** within the Design System's Figma file
- Browse the **components** by clicking the "Assets" tab and expanding the
  "Global Design System" dropdown; each component provided by the Design System is
  represented by an item in this list
- **Shared styles** can be explored by clicking on a layer and expanding the
  Style menu next to a layer property (Text, Fill, Stroke, and Effects)

<!-- - Additionally, you can duplicate the Compassion Design System
  Playground\_ Figma file to see some stellar examples of the Design System put to
  use. -->

## Now What?

You're all set to start designing and building with compassion. We hope you find
the Design System empowering and flexible as you build with the neighbour in
mind. It would be a huge joy if you'd join our global community of designers
and developers to be a part of sharpening one anothers' skills and improving the
Design System together!

### Grow Alongside the CDS!

Periodically we publish updates of new elements, components, and layouts
submitted by our global neighbours. Check out the Updating the CDS page for more
info on how that works, the list of checks and balances we follow, and how to
update your experiences as the Design System grows!

As you become more comfortable working with the Compassion Design System, we'd
love for you to contribute to it for the good of all of our global neighbours!
The CDS is built on the premise that collectively we are better and when we come
together and serve one another with open hands, open minds, and open hearts,
nothing can stand against us. Check out the [How to Contribute - For
