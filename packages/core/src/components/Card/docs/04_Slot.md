### Slot

The slot component allows designers to include other components in the content of the card. This can be useful for displaying additional information or providing more interactivity to the user. Some examples of components that could be included in a slot are buttons, text, or other UI elements that can help to enhance the functionality of the card. When using a slot, be sure to consider the size and placement of the component to ensure that it does not detract from the overall readability and usability of the card.
