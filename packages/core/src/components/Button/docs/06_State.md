### State

- **Default:** The normal appearance of a button when it is not being interacted with. It is usually a solid color with text that indicates the action the button will perform when clicked.
- **Hover:** When the user hovers their mouse over the button. It is usually a subtle change in appearance, such as a color change, to indicate to the user that the button is interactive.
- **Disabled:** The appearance of a button when it cannot be interacted with. This is typically used when the user has not filled out a required form field or when the user is not authorized to perform a certain action. The button is usually grayed out or has a different opacity to indicate that it is not active.
