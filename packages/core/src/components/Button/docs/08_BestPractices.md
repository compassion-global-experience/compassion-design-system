## Best Practices

- Ensure your buttons have clear labels. Users should be able to predict what will happen when they click a button. Avoid using generic labels like "Click here".
- Only use CTA buttons to highlight the main call to action on a page.
- Limit the number of actions a user can take at one time. If there are too many buttons on one page, it can lead to decision fatigue for the user.
- Use button sizes that are large enough to accommodate finger targets for touch screens.
