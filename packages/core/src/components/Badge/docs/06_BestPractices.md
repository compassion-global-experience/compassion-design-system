## Best Practices

- Use badges sparingly and only for important information or actions.
- Keep the text on the badge short and concise.
- Ensure that the badge is visually distinct from other elements on the page.
- Consider using color to convey meaning, but also ensure that the colors used meet accessibility guidelines.
