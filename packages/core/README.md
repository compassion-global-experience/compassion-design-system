# Compassionâ€™s Core Design System

The `@compassion-gds/core` package serves as a framework-free base allowing to apply the Compassion Design System to any application.  
Framework-specific packages are available to apply the Compassion Design System to specific frameworks.

## Installation

### NPM

```bash
npm install @compassion-gds/core
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @compassion-gds/core
```

## Usage

The package is only meant to be used directly in a vanilla JavaScript application, where we apply
styles via css classes. Frameworks (like React) should use the framework-specific packages.

### Load the CSS

Load the css by either declaring link tags for the html document or by importing the css file in your application.

#### HTML
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@compassion-gds/core/dist/{theme}.css">
<!--Optionally include the following css rest file to reset the browser styles-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@compassion-gds/core/reset.css">
```

#### JS
```js
import '@compassion-gds/core/{theme}.css';
// Optionally include the following css rest file to reset the browser styles
import '@compassion-gds/core/reset.css';
```

## How it works

The `@compassion-gds/core` package converts Figma design tokens into CSS variables and CSS classes.
This happens in 4 steps:
- The Figma design tokens are pulled from a remote repository: https://github.com/compassion-global-experience/cds-tokens.git (see [scripts/get-figma-tokens.sh](scripts/get-figma-tokens.sh))
- Then they are converted to a JSON file that we can use with [style-dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) (see [scripts/convert-figma-tokens.sh](scripts/convert-figma-tokens.sh))
- Then the JSON file is converted to CSS variables and CSS classes (see [scripts/generate-css-vars.cjs](scripts/generate-css-vars.cjs))
- And finally we generate CSS files for each theme (`npm run bundle-css`)

All this is combined into the `npm run build` command.
The `build` command is also run as a pre-publish step.

## Contributing to the `@compassion-gds/core` Package

The `@compassion-gds/core` package is structured with a component-per-directory convention
inside the `src` directory. Each component directory generally contains 2 items:

- A **CSS file** composable css classes to achieve the design system specs
- A **.stories.js file** that illustrates most of the ways the component can be configured

### Install the dependencies
- Run `npm install`

### Building CSS variables
- Run `npm run build`

### Running storybook
- Run `npm start` or `npm run storybook`
