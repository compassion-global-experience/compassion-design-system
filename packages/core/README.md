## Contributing to the `@compassion-gds/core` Package

The `@compassion-gds/core` package is structured with a component-per-directory convention
inside the `src` directory. Each component directory generally contains 2 items:

- A **CSS file** composable css classes to achieve the design system specs
- A **.stories.js file** that illustrates most of the ways the component can be configured
