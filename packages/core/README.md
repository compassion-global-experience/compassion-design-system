## Contributing to the `css` Package

The `css` package is structured with a component-per-directory convention
inside the `src` directory. Each component directory generally contains 2 items:

- A **CSS file** composable css classes to achieve the design system specs
- A **.stories.js file** that illustrates most of the ways the component can be configured
